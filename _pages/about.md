This is a technical blog for my notes on Machine Learning, Big Data Analysis and other interesting topics. 

Many posts on these topics are too complicated and require huge background to understand. I strive to make my posts in plain English while grabbing the key ideas to make them friendly and accessible to newcomers. I will be very glad if someone can benefit from my posts.

I'm not a native English speaker, so please feel free to correct mistakes in my expression as well as in my posts.

Thank you!
