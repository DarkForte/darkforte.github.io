I'm a PhD student in Peking University doing research on reinforcement learning. I get my bachelor's degree from Beijing University of Technology.

When I was an undergraduate, I participated in ACM-ICPC for three years and won several silver medals in regional contests, including the EC-Final round held in China. 

I spent my last year in undergraduate doing internship in Microsoft Research Asia. I took responsibility for a research project called "BigIn4", which is the backend of [Quick Insights](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-service-auto-insights/) feature in Microsoft Power BI. I learned a lot about big data processing and Hadoop and Spark framework there. The system is successfully demonstrated on the TAB meeting and TechFest in Microsoft. At the end of my internship, I was awarded the "Star of Tomorrow" title for excellent performance.

I wish I could become an excellent technical leader and build stable as well as clever systems in the future. 

Apart from academics, I love anime very much and taught myself Japanese. I'm a LoveLiver and have been to Tokyo Dome to attend `Final LoveLive!` in 2016. I also like music games like `Taiko no Tatsujin` and `Beatmania IIDX`.
